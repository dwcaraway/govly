### Overview

This document aims to explain the best way to work with the product and its components.

All the best and enjoy coding.

### Getting started

- Do not start from scratch, use an existing asset and modify it to learn how it works.
- Explore the sources for ideas and sample code.
- Use Firebug or Chrome Developer Tools to find bugs on your website. Using one of those tools will help you to save time analizing the site and finding elements structure, like classes, id or tags
  - Quick tip: open your site with Chrome, press F12 and go to console tab, reload your page and if something goes wrong you will see your page errors in red text.
- In case of error messages, someone might have seen it too, so you can try a google search for a quick fix.

### Starting the app

Since this is AngularJS based application you need a server (Apache, IIS, xampp, etc)to serve the html files and perform http request to load all views.

Opening the index.html with a double click (i.e. using file:// protocol) will show you only a blank page because there's no server that response to the requests made for each view in order to display the app interface.

#### Main folders explanation

__app/__ folder
 
This folder contains the compiled files. __This files are ready to deploy on your server.__ 
 
- pages/
This folder contains the compiled html files for the single pages (out of the app).
- views/
This folder contains the compiled html files for the views and partials used for the app. 
- i18n/
This folder contains the json files use for translation.

__master/__ folder
 
This folder contains the source files. You will find the following folders inside
 
- jade/
This folder contains JADE files. This files need to be compiled into html files to be displayed by a browser
- less/
This folder contains the LESS files for the core styles and bootstrap styles. 
- js/
Here you will find pure JS files. All this files are concatenated into the file app.js. 
 
__vendor/__ folder
 
This folder contains the vendor files used to include plugins and other components. All this components are untouched from its original version so in case you have to update some of them you can do it by simply replacing its content.

__server/__ folder
 
This folder contains server side files (php and json) used for demonstration and guide for the flot chart and file upload components.
  
- __sidebar-menu.json__
This file is __important and required__ because it contains the sidebar menu definition.

### Custom code

To add your own code you can follow this instructions:

__Working with css and js__

- Create a file app/css/custom.css and add your own styles
- Create a file app/js/custom.js and add your own javscript
- Edit the file index.html and include custom.css after all other css files and custom.js after all other js files.

__Working with source files__

- For JS, go to folder master/js/custom and start editing the file custom.js. After compile the source again with gulp, your own code will included at th bottom of file app/js/app.js.
- For LESS, go to folder master/less and create a folder called custom and add your won less files. Then edit file app.less and @import all your stylesheets at the bottom (overrides all app default styles)

__A note on updating__

> The premise is, the less you change the downloaded code, the easier will be to apply any updates. Try always to keep your own code the most separated as possible from the package code to easily apply new updates when necessary.

Build
-----

**Important!** You only need to follow this instructions in case you want to work with JADE, LESS and concatenate all JS modules.

### Node and Gulp

__Node.js__ is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.

__Gulp__ is a task manager, you can define different tasks to run certain commands. Those commands does the compilation job for JADE and LESS, and concats the JS files.

The package includes under the master/ folder the file __gulpfile.js__ and __package.json__ to install the required components to compile the source files.

The following steps are intended to be an orientation guide, if you are not experienced with this you will need to learn more about it from Google :)

- To install node and npm, go to http://nodejs.org/
- Open a terminal in the master/ folder, then run the command __npm install__. This command will install gulp and all project dependences. 
- Finally run __gulp__ to start the task manager 

If everything goes fine, you should see the messages in the terminal telling you that most the task are done ok. The task will watch for files to compile them automatically all files when change.

To enable the automatic page reload there is also included a LiveReload task that requires the Chrome plugin [Livereload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei)

### Javascript

The Javascript source is divided in two main files that controls the app

__base.js__: contains the scripts to start the application

__app.js__: contains the modules used in the application (controllers, directive, etc)

The edit the scripts included in base.js open the file gulpfile.js and edit the array `vendorBaseScripts`

The app.js script build (concat) order is 

```
'js/app.init.js'
'js/modules/*.js'
'js/modules/controllers/*.js'
'js/modules/directives/*.js'
'js/modules/services/*.js'
'js/modules/filters/*.js'
```

### LESS

The LESS files compiles into the file __app.css__. This file contains the bootstrap styles and the application custom styles.

Also the __app-rtl.css__ is automatically generated with the same styles but inverted for RTL layout. To convert styles the node script css-flip is used.

Usage
-----

### Layout

Layout can be changed via the following classed applied to the __body__ tag

`.layout-fixed`: Makes navbars become fixed while the user can scoll only content

`.layout-boxed`: Limits the width of the main wrapper element

`.aside-collapsed`: Condenses the sidebar showing only icons

`.aside-toggle`: used internally for mobiles to hide the sidebar off screen

`.offsidebar-open`: used internally to display the offsidebar component (formally the right sidebar) 

The following markup representation is in fact divided into views but this code will give a good perspective of the final organization after the app is rendered:

``` html
<html>
  <head>
    #metas and css
  </head>  
  <body>
    <section class="wrapper" data-ui-view>

        #start include from app.html
          <nav class="navbar topnavbar">
            #top navbar content
          </nav>
   
          <aside class="aside">
            #sidebar content (left)
          </aside>
   
          <aside class="offsidebar">
            #offsidebar content (right)
          </aside>
   
          <section>
            <div class="content-wrapper" data-ui-view>
              #page content
            </div>  
          </section>
        #end include from app.html

     </section>
 
     #scripts
 
  </body>
</html>
```

### Lazy Load

This app requires only the necessary scripts according to the view that is loaded saving tons unnecessary request to the server.

The lazy load is handled by a custom core function based on the plugin [ocLazyLoad](https://github.com/ocombe/ocLazyLoad)

To configure the lazy scripts, you need to edit the constants `APP_REQUIRES` (constants.js)  
Then edit the app configuration (config.js) where you will find the routes configuration and add or edit the params using the special function `resolveFor` which handles the scripts request order for the current route.

### RTL

RTL support uses the a tool called [css-flip](https://github.com/twitter/css-flip) which inverts most the css properties to change the page orientation.  
It's also a property `$rootScope.isRTL`  to detect when the site is in RTL mode. 

### Routes

This app uses for routing the [AngularUI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router) with nested states making more simple to manage the routing system and load resource in cascade.

All routes are defined in the file __config.js__

### Translation

The translation system uses the [AngularUI Translate](https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate) module.  
This modules simplifies the translation system by loading translate references from a JSON file and replacing the content where the reference has been used.

Examples

``` html
<h3 ui-translate="reference.NAME">Text that will be replaced</h3>

<h3>{{ 'reference.NAME' | translate }}</h3>

<a href="#" title="{{ 'reference.NAME' | translate }">Link</a>
```

The JSON files with translation refernces are located in the folder app/i18n

### Dynamic Sidebar

The sidebar is created dynamically from a JSON file.  

__JSON properties format:__

``` js
[
  {
    "text":      "Item text",          // replaced by translate reference
    "sref":      "app.dashboard",      // the state name of the target route
    "icon":      "icon-speedometer",   // the icon full classname
    "translate": "sidebar.ITEM",       // the translation reference
    "heading":   "true"                // only when item is used as heading 
  },

  ...

]
```

This is method is also useful if you pretend to generate a per user menu dynamically in the server.

### Markdown Docs

This documentation is loaded from a Markdown source using [Flatdoc](http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/) plugin.
The menu and the content is generated automatically from the .md file and styled directly from custom css.

Via the `flatdoc` directive you can use it like this

``` html
<flatdoc src="path/to/readme.md"></flatdoc>
```

### Icons

Icons included from

* [__Font Awesome__](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/)
* [__Skycons__](http://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/)
* [__Weather Icons__](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/)

### Themes

To change the color scheme you have 2 options:

#### From LESS files

Edit the LESS files in folder __master/less/app__ and the file __master/less/bootstrap/variables.less__ to use the color you want.  
Like Bootstrap, most of the colors are based on `@brand-*` variables.

You can also edit the files in __master/less/theme__ folder to create your own set of color schemes. This files must be included after the __app.css__ in order to override the default color set.

> Changing the theme from LESS files helps you to avoid bloating your css by not double declaring your color rules.

#### From CSS files

This template support color schemes including a css file. You can find the color options in the folder app/css/  files are named theme-*.css

If you want to change or add a new component color, just inspect the color using your favorite browser devtool and then replace the value in the file.

This files are prepared to change the basic color scheme (both sidebars and  top navbar) but if you want to make a more deep change I suggest you to check the LESS way which is more simple for multiple component changes.
